# Code_Cumbria_Arduino
---

During my Code Cumbria course, we learned how to program microcontrollers using C++.<br>
The Course provided the template files and then tasked learners with expanding on the code with more functionality.<br>
The initial files were mainly to teach the basics of the language, syntax, and how the microcontroller could be programmed to affect a breadboard circuit with an LED.

The tasks grew in complexity, as we learened how to program latching buttons, cycle an LED through different colours, generate random numbers and finally use a HC-SR04 sonic sensor to measure physical distance.
